# REB3 timing for E2V CCD, in new REB sequencer format
# more experimental sequences
# (C. Juramy, 20160201)
# 20160321 modified with include functionality, CCS-compatible keywords
# 20160909 added blocks for E2V study

[includes]  # inheritance from other files (in increasing priority order, current file last)

[constants]  # will be substituted in the code at compilation time

[clocks]  # clock channels

[pointers]  # can define a pointer to a function or to a repetition number (for subroutines or functions)
    REP_SUBR    ReadBlocks     10  # Number of blocks to read (set PostRows to match)

[functions]
    ReadReverse:  # Clocks in reverse direction and reads as usual
